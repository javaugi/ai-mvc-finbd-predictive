The shift from traditional (NgModule-based) to standalone Angular is a move towards a simpler, more modern, and less verbose architecture. 
    Standalone components, the default since Angular 19, are self-contained units that manage their own dependencies directly, removing the 
    need for a wrapping NgModule. 

Here is a comparison of the key differences:

Feature             Traditional Angular (NgModules) / Latest Standalone Angular
Declaration         Components, directives, and pipes must be declared within an NgModule's declarations array.	
                        Components, directives, and pipes are self-contained (standalone: true flag in the decorator).
Dependencies        Dependencies (other components, directives, pipes, or modules like FormsModule) are managed in the NgModule's imports array.	
                        Dependencies are imported directly within the component's imports array.
Boilerplate         Requires more boilerplate code (separate module files).	
                        Significantly less boilerplate, leading to cleaner code and fewer files.
Lazy Loading        Requires lazy loading entire feature modules.	
                        Supports direct lazy loading of individual standalone components in the router configuration, which is simpler and more intuitive.
Tree Shaking        Can be less effective, as entire modules may be included even if only parts are used.	
                        Improved tree-shaking capabilities, as unused dependencies are more easily identified and eliminated during the build process.
Learning Curve      Familiar to seasoned Angular developers.	
                        A simpler mental model for new developers and a more straightforward onboarding process.
Interoperability	Can use standalone components by importing them into the NgModule.	
                        Can import traditional NgModules into a standalone component's imports array.

Summary of Benefits for Standalone
1. Simpler Architecture: Components become the true core building blocks, simplifying project structure.
2. Faster Development: Less boilerplate and a clearer structure allow for quicker development cycles.
3. Better Modularity: Improved encapsulation means components manage their own needs, promoting reusability across different parts of an 
    application or even separate projects.
4. Performance: Better tree-shaking results in smaller bundle sizes and faster application load times. 
5. While traditional modules are still fully supported and useful for existing applications, new Angular projects generated by the CLI use 
    the standalone API by default, showcasing it as the recommended approach for modern development.
